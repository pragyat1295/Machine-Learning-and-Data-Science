the fault of the actors for sure the cast certainly portrayed their roles well it is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of truly sick mind br br do know that will never ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch she is sick twisted foul mouthed foul thinking deviant she looks speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs who spent 20 years doing hard time you can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the dvd special features section of surveillance the watched are watching you can see and hear her for yourself she was every bit as bad as had envisioned from the writing of this movie br br m not shocked by bad language although this director certainly talks like sailor this goes far beyond simple bad language worse than any p0rn film the level of implied sado violence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p0rn standards this perverse disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says another reviewer found the description was seeking this is snuff film br br be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending this director writer is truly sick person can believe anyone would put her in charge of movie much less pay her for it you can be assured that will never ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with in the thousands of movies have watched and collected there are only couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott she is offensive beyond anyone have ever seen connected with filming movie before there have been some bad directors and writers but none could compare to her sick twisted mind br br when saw this movie which was just one murder rampage after another once it got past the hotel murder then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks the vacation family with the bad parents who had no business being in the presence of children followed by the drug addicts the movie then proceeded to the even more twisted deviant serial killers br br as saw the serial killers reveal themselves began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie those were my actual thoughts as watched this movie fully intended to find out what writer had such sick mind because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long term psychiatric treatment to my surprise it turned out to be the director when saw and heard what she had to say on the dvd realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose on the dvd she was indeed the sick twisted person had envisioned writing such disturbing film br br while the little girl stephanie ryan simpkins truly stole the show can believe that her real life parents would have tolerated this sick foul mouthed director to be anywhere near their daughter br br this movie is disturbing sick offensive twisted and the director writer needs some serious treatment in mental facility br br as far as the ending of the movie goes the alternate ending should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal there was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character m stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie the trailer was completely misleading the only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer that trailer is not representative of the movie you will see br br other than the child every character in this movie was sick murderous twisted perverse violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer director who created them but if you watch it carefully even the parents of the vacationing family the sick cops taking pot shots the serial killers posing in alternate roles cops in the station and even the station dispatcher every single one of these character roles incorporated sexually twisted violent pervert m not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the canadian town in the special features section of the dvd br br this writer director has such personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps the only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child watch closely and you will see this in every character then listen to the director writer talk on the dvd special features section and you will understand what m telling you about her mental state and psychological issues she wouldn be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from hollywood film making family br br fortunately jennifer chambers lynch does not have much of filmography less than handful of things since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles don think we ll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad director david lynch helps her out d recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with and m not too sure her dad films would be any better br br do yourself favor avoid anything written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch ',\n",

husband to the refuge of her parents home in india to viewers of western societies it may seem perfectly reasonable indeed natural that any abused woman would seek the protective guardianship of her parents this however is societal taboo in many eastern cultures india among them once woman has been married the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal assets family business children etc for her to turn her back on these responsibilities is grave social sin one which truly has no equivalent for the western woman she is thereafter regarded as tainted and as damaged goods one whose value has been nullified entirely by her own actions and her refusal to submit to the role she has been given she is not so much an individual as she is an emblem of familial honor her father rebukes her for her actions concerned that his familial honor will be tarnished irreparably by the daughter he had already transferred to another man his primary concern is that of the impending marriage of vaidehi younger sister prospect made far less likely with divorced elder daughter in the same household he tells her in no uncertain that she must return to the man to whom she lawfully belongs however violent and sadistic he may be he levies against her the age old adage that the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter quietly and pensively she replies yes the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter but there is no honor for the daughter herself ',\n",

driving through and needed directions seriously the cop then talks to nicole outside totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him over br br the cop quickly starts telling nicole that he a goner who lucky to be breathing still yet he strangely doesn die for quite while the two of them do some more pointless talking and the all important fact that he has gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long time when the two of them finally try to use the gun nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at door when the killer was possibly behind it with two bullets left the policeman tells nicole to use one to euthanize him she fires one into his mouth and he lays still for few moments with chunk blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and she has to shoot him again completely cheap attempt at shock br br nicole finally confronts the killerâ and fails the movie ends with scene taking place not long from then with woman

       " 'there something going on in this film directed by files scribe john shiban that has eluded me you get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems yet feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward it about perception there are characters the heroine nicole jaimie alexander meets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish this might seem like spoiler but it something that really only inherits wee bit of focus on the filmmakers part they seem to be poking fun at us as we watch curious at whether we should trust what nicole is seeing or not it never gets proper answer and for one was bit clueless at the point there comes time in film when ambiguity can just be frustrating because the viewer is led on wild goose chase that ends at dead end with little explanation at what we just saw it ultimately feels like an exhausting exercise instead of thrilling psycho drama now there nothing wrong with ambiguity itself but give us something to latch onto or you will evade us that how felt as watched rest stop this film is supposedly about young woman named nicole who decides to run off to california with lover jesse joey mendicino to make it big in hollywood they make what is supposed to be slight detour at rest stop so that nicole can pee but it descends into terror for her when she finds that her jesse is completely missing someone in crusty dusty yellow truck is nut job who seems to be causing lot of trouble to nicole and we soon realize that he is behind jesse disappearance when things start to occur signs provided to her if you will she will have to find way out of very difficult situation nicole is far from any existing town and with limited resources to defend herself against maniac who provides her with some strong evidence of how evil he can be br br that the easy part when female character comes into play the film makes really bizarre leap from logic as we are not sure where she ever came from how she got there and more importantly where she goes once nicole tries to break her free from her supposed prison in the restroom utilities cabinet she meets another police officer in the area joey lawrence who might seem like her savior but when he too is victim of the truck driver startling things occur again that questions if he was ever actually even there to begin with the truck driver commits torturous acts to nicole like holing her up in the restroom and as she tries to untie wire that the killer has wrapped around the door lock she receives nasty bite from him he then sets fire to the restroom leaving her without lasting place of refuge from the beast br br it the timing of the truck driver attacks that has me listless perhaps he just likes tormenting her but he appropriately appears in certain situations where nicole has time to flee or prepare it doesn make much sense his motives which propel the film into an illogical idea why does he make himself so obvious why does he allow her to prepare it seems m going out on limb here that he likes having his quarry believe they can find way of escape only to stomp that hope out when he comes up with his next grisly attack yet why does shiban decide to play with the viewer by having nicole experience odd meetings with people that don exist what is shiban and the writing team trying to say and to cap off the film unhinged weirdness is family in rv they play small part in the scheme of things as religious bigots themselves but the film doesn do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this film at all ',\n",
